\section*{Acknowledgements}
All my gratitude goes to my supervisors, Stephan Schiffel, for proposing this project and getting me started in this icelandic experience, and Christos Dimitrakakis, for making it possible. Thanks to both for giving me the opportunity of working on this project, and for all the support that has been given me throughout the last months. I would also like to thank Staffan Björk, my examiner, for putting up with this work.\\

Thank you to all the people that participated (more or less willingly) in the data collection, your help has been highly appreciated.\\

I am thankful to my family, who encouraged me to keep going, and a big thank you to the people that have been around, being them in Italy, Sweden, Iceland, or anywhere else in the world.\\

Lastly, none of this would have been possible without such an amazing person by my side. Hjörtur Björnsson, this thesis is for you.\\

Grazie mille. Tack så mycket. Takk kærlega.
